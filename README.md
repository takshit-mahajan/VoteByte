# VoteByte
This is a mini project that simulates the Indian political system using Object-Oriented Programming. It models election commissions, candidates, and vote management. Candidate data is stored in binary using bytes and bytearray, enabling encoding, decoding, and real-time vote updates through digital election simulation.
